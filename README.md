# TermInfo

A library for parsing binary ncurses terminfo descriptions, except it's in
javascript. **Gross**.<br/>
Also comes with a compiler and runtime for executing string capabilities.<br/>
Written against ncurses 6.4. Does not support the berkeley database format
("hashed database"), but I haven't seen that used anywhere.
